                introduction: 'Rice has been cultivated in many parts of the world especially in South and South-East Asia as a stable crop. Important producing areas are China, India, Spain, Brazil, Italy and Southern U.S. It is now becoming important in West Africa especially Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana as well as Sierra Leone. Rice plant is believed to have originated and evolved from South-East Asia where it spread to China, India, Africa and America. Thousands of cultivars are now available and more and more are being evolved by selection and breeding for better adaption to the many environments in which the crop can be grown. Nearly all varieties fall into 2 main classifications',

                        passage:'The rice which is found between latitude 45ºN and 40ºS and from sea level to as high as 3000m is a versatile crop which does well under a wide range of climatic conditions provided that there is an adequate water through rainfall or irrigation. Thus upland rice grows very well under conditions of high rainfall which is evenly distributed throughout the growth period whilst swamp rice thrive on flat lowlands, river basins where flooding occurs during the growth period. Temperatures must range from 20-38ºC preferably between 30-35ºC during the day with a minimum of 20ºC at night. The temperature should be high enough to ensure good seedling development and vegetative growth. There must be abundant sunshine i.e. high solar radiation income especially during the period of reproduction or grain filling. Grain yields have been found to be positively correlated with solar radiation income. The crop is a short day plant, hence there is the need to select and grow cultivars which are insensitive to the changing photoperiod in order to prevent heading / flowering at the time when crops have not yet fully developed its photosynthetic system or vegetative growth.',

The optimum pH range for rice is from 5.5-7.0 (acidic to neutral) even though the crop can be successfully grown on soils with values rising as high as 6-9 or falling as low as 5-4. The crop shows a degree of tolerance to salinity.',

                culturalPractices:[
                    'Choice of site- this depends on type of rice grown and the management practices envisaged. Upland or swamp rice requires different sites and whether the crop will be irrigated or not.',
                    'Land preparation- it must be very thorough with a maximum of two ploughing, preferably to a depth of 30cm. In situations where the land is being cleared for the first time, plant remains or organic matter may be incorporated into the soil. Planting can be direct in the field by broadcasting or dibbling or drilling. The first two are manual and the last mechanical. Transplanting of seedlings can also be practiced. In this case, seedlings must be raised in nursery beds. With transplants, more clean seeds (35-45kg/ha) must be used and transplanting done at 21 days after seeding at a spacing of 20x20cm at 2 plants per hill. Do no transplant seedlings which are more than 35days due to early panicle exertion which severely reduces yield. Seed rate depends upon the method of planting, the spacing required and the tillering habit of cultivars. The rate varies from 84-112kg/ha for broadcasting, 56-67kg/ha for nurseries which also gives opportunity for selection at 28-35kg/ha for dibbling and drilling. Of course these figures are only guidelines and may be varied according to ones circumstances. It is also presupposed that there is high percentage germination. The seeds are tested for fullness and adequate weight by soaking in brine/salt solution of specific gravity of 1.1-1.13. The light seeds or empty glumes float and are removed and discarded. The good ones are dried, treated against pests and diseases and can then be sown by broadcasting, dibbling, drilling in the nursery. ',
                    'Weed control- many of the common arable weeds are controlled by flooding and standing water. Weeds are worst in broadcasting than when the plants are transplanted as the latter gives the better condition for control. Better weed control is achieved when the rice is drilled or transplanted in lines. Failure to control weeds can result in losses of 30% or more. Serious weeds are wild red rice and other grass weeds e.g Cyperus. Weed may be controlled by hand weeding or mechanically or chemically controlled. Hand hoeing or hand operated rotary hoes have been used in many parts of the world. Herbicides 2, 4-D, Lasso attrazine, roundup or gramoxone may be used as preplanting, pre-emergence or post-emergence treatment.',
                    'Diseases – Blast (Pyricularia oryzae) is most serious. It can attack the plant at all stages causing seedling blight, leaf blight in the active growing phase and neck rot when the heads are developing. The best control is to plant resistant cultivars or the use of copper fungicides. Mercurial dressing will also help. Other diseases are brown spot, leaf spot (caused by Cercospora oryzae) and stem rot (caused by Sclerotium rolfsii) ',
                    'Pest – Insects cause extensive damage to the rice crop in the field and to the grain during storage. The worst pests are stem borers, plant bugs, armyworms and grasshoppers. Others include rats or rodents and birds.',
                    'Fertilization – Apply 1.5 bags/ha of muriate of potash and 2.5bags/ha of triple supper phosphate as basal dressing. Apply urea in split doses, 2 bags/ha at transplanting and another 2 bags/ha top dress at panicle initiation stage or add 2.5 t/ha 14 decomposed poultry manure or 5t/ha cow dung.',
                    'Harvesting – Early harvesting cultivars are usually harvested one month after full flowering and late ones at 6 weeks. Thus between 4-6 weeks after full flowering, harvesting should be done. The moisture content of the grain at harvest is usually between 18-25%. Harvesting is done by hand using knife or sickle or mechanized by combined harvesters. Threshing This is done to separate the grains with its enclosing husk from the stalk. It may be done manually by beating the sheath against a hard surface.',
                    'Winnowing - It is usually done by shaking and tossing the paddy backwards and forward with a basket tray with a narrow rim. After winnowing, the paddy is dried in the sun and is now ready for milling or transport to the mill. Using combine harvester, the paddy is harvested, threshed and bagged in one operation after which it is dried to safe moisture content of 11-14%.',
                    'Storage / milling - The paddy is stored in the husk as it is less susceptible to deterioration. It is essential that the paddy should be well dried before storage as this prevents heating and sweating, and reduces attack by storage pest and fungi. The optimum moisture content should be between 12.5-14% which also gives minimum loss and breakage at milling. The paddy 15 may be parboiled before milling. Parboiling of paddy before milling gives less breakage of grains, more retention of nutrients (protein, vitamins and minerals) and better storage qualities. 100kg of paddy gives approximately 66kg of polished rice of which 50kg is whole grain and 16kg is broken grains. Yields vary and are between 4-5t/ha of milled rice in advanced countries and well managed fields. The average is between 2-2.5t/ha. For paddy, it is between 7-9t/ha.',

The ovary is surrounded by a long style known as the silk which emerges from the husk and is receptive along most of the length. The spikelet at the base matures first. The maize caryopsis is covered by a thin wall of layers of cells representing the fused pericarp and testa. Next to this layer is the nucellus and next to this is the endosperm.

The operation should be done at shallow depth as possible enough to kill weeds and open up the soil but not to damage roots of crops. The frequency should be determined by the growth of weeds. Chemical weed control is being increasingly used and various herbicides are recommended. Gramoxone is applied at 4l/ha or 300ml/ 15litres of water into the knapsack for spray. The use of round up is more effective on perennial weeds and application rate is 4l/ha or 300ml/15litres of water. Pre-emergence herbicides e.g Lasso atrazine may be applied after planting at a rate of 2.5kg/ha or 4l/ha for primagram',
                    'Irrigation - Maize can be irrigated where the rainfall is not sufficient to sustain good yields or where the distribution is erratic to suppress growth at the most sensitive stages which are from the periods just before tasseling to the middle of grain filling. Also moisture stress during the early growth suppresses leaf area development and can delay flowering.

The original domesticated sorghums, used for food and for beer making, spread rapidly across East and West Africa and were taken to India at an early date and to China. The crop reached the Americas in the middle of the 19th century. Sorghum remains an important food crop in dry areas and on poor soils in many African countries, in India, and in China; 50 million hectares are grown worldwide, producing over 58 million tonnes. Very little sorghum enters world trade except that exported by the United States for industrial use.",
